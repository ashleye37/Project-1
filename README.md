### TripBot
TripBot is an interactive app that utilizes a questionnaire to help facilitate hotel and restaurant suggestions based on a location input by our user. 

### How It Works
* Users sign in utilizing firebase authentication allowing the user to access TripBot using Google. 
* Once signed in users are prompted to answer a couple of questions to help TripBot customize their trip planning experience. 
* After submition of the questionnaire the app utilizes an AJAX call to the FourSquare API to assist in providing users with card suggestions for restaurants, hotels and activities in their selected location. 
* Users can dynamically select the hotel and restaurants of their choice and move them to their dashboard section, via buttons attached to each card. 
* Once in their dashboard section, these hotels, restaurants, and activities are saved as their itinerary.
* They can select the New Trip button to start a new trip at any time as well.
