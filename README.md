### TripBot
TripBot is an interactive app that utilizes a questionnaire to help facilitate hotel and restaurant suggestions based on a location input by our user. 

### How It Works
* Users sign in utilizing firebase authentication process allowing them to access TripBot using Google. 
* Once signed in users are prompted to answer a couple of questions to help TripBot customize their trip planning experience. 
* After submition of the questionnaire the app utilizes an AJAX call to the FourSquare API to assist in providing users with card suggestions for both restaurants and hotels in their selected location. 
* Users can dynamically select the hotel and restaurants of their choice and move them to their dashboard section, via draggable cards. 
* Once in their dashboard section these hotel and restaurant suggestions are saved as their itinerary.
